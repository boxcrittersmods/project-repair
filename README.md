# Project Repair
Fixes of old projects that the creator no longer works on, such as:

* Outdated texturepacks and shaders
* Mods that are too old to work on the current versions of boxcritters
* Projects that can't be accessed due to missing links
* Mods that rely on now-broken projects

And potentially more in the future.
